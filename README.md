# TaskPlanner

This software tries to solve a version of the vehicle routing problem.
It uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the routes of multiple workers 
serving multiple clients at different locations with different priorities.

The actual algorithm is implemented in C++ and is used by the UI, which 
is written using the React framework, using Web Assembly.
